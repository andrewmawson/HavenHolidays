/*

Test completed by Andrew Mawson:

To run project, just compile in Xcode 11.3 or higher.
No 3rd Party libs have been used.
No time left for tests, I would start with testing the JSON is valid and creates the group(s), then move on to the SiteService and testing of each of the ViewModel's, with most robust testing around SiteViewModel route calculations.
I suspect the UISlider is firing too often, this could be made more efficient.
